I am an AI/ML product manager who also works on fun data science side projects and Kaggle competitions. I founded <a href="https://www.datascienceinstitute.ai/">Cascadia Data Science Institute</a> in 2018. The repos in my Github are quite old and not reflective of what I have been working on - most of my work is in Kaggle and on my Colab Notebooks. 

<H4>More on Cascadia Data Science Institute:</H4>
Our goal is to be the professional network for AI/ML product managers, researchers, and practitioners. <br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Vision:</b> A world where the benefits of AI/ML are equally accessible to all, regardless of race, gender, or socio-economic background.
  <li><b>Mission:</b> We bring together current and future AI/ML leaders in product, research, data science, data engineering, and MLOps to learn together and support each other in honing our specialties so that we can advance our careers and humanity.
